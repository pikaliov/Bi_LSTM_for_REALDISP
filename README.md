# Bi_LSTM_for_REALDISP

My first steps to train a Bidirectional LSTM with the [REALDISP Activity Recognition Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/REALDISP+Activity+Recognition+Dataset). 
The Bidirectional LSTM is a special recurrent neural network (RNN), which was defined by [J. Schmidhuber & A. Graves](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005001206).
I used [Keras](https://keras.io/) to implement my Network with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) backend. 

Include:
- Dataset preparation
- Data visualisation 
- Train a Bi-LSTM and classify the activitys
