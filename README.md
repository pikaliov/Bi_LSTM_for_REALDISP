# Bi_LSTM_for_REALDISP

My first steps to train a Bidirectional LSTM with the REALDISP Activity Recognition Dataset Data Set [REALDISP Activity Recognition Dataset Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/REALDISP+Activity+Recognition+Dataset). 

Include:
- Dataset preparation
- Data visualisation 
- Train a Bi-LSTM and classify the activitys
